1)=> Stack:
------------
1. Implement a Stack class using raw pointers.
2. Add methods to demonstrate method chaining.
3. Implement a function showElements() to display the contents of the stack.
4. Create the following constructors:
-Default constructor
-Parameterized constructor
5. Create a destructor to properly delete dynamically allocated memory (raw pointer).
6. Add a static counter to track the number of Stack objects created.
7. Create a static method to display this counter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

2)=> Complex Class:
-------------------
1. Create a Complex class to represent complex numbers.
2. Add data members: real, image
3. Add a counter to track how many objects are created.
4. Implement the following constructors:
Default constructor
Overloaded constructor: Complex(float), Complex(float, float) 
5. Implement a destructor that decrements the counter.
6. Add a method showCounter() to display the number of active objects.
7. Add a method printComplex() to display the number in a readable format, showing different cases
- 5+7i
- -3-3i
- -8i
- 8i
- 8i
- -9i
- -9+3i
- 8+i
8. Print which constructor or destructor is being called at runtime.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

3)=> Design a BankAccount Class:
--------------------------------

Simulate a simple banking system using classes.
1. Design a BankAccount class with the following data members:
- accountHolder (name)
- accountNumber (auto-generated (incremented) using nextID)
- balance
- counter (to count total accounts created)
2. Implement constructors:
Default constructor
Parameterized constructor
3. Implement methods:
deposit → increases balance and returns a reference to the object (to support chaining).
withdraw → decreases balance.
showAccount() → displays all account information.
getBalance() → returns the current balance.
showCounter() → to display how many accounts were created.
